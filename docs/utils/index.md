# Utils
Stric provides a general-purpose utility library for web developement.

Install using Bun:
```bash
bun add @stricjs/utils 
```

The library includes CORS handling, CSP header builder, cookie builder, 
basic authentication header parsers and much more...

Note that most of `@stricjs/utils` utilities can be used without other 
Stric components like `@stricjs/app`.
